						Hi!! Welcome to the unveiling of a new me üòö. I'm so glad you could join me, and I appreciate your presence during my reformation. I realize you always knew how a mature version of me could positively impact this world ; sheesh, thank you for being such an amazing sister. I have just one expectation from you: that you continue being the great sister/friend you have always been until now. I was too dumb to understand before, but now it feels good to know that I have a sibling I can turn to anytime to rant about my problems, and she'll listen all the way and help me out of my misery. Thanks? ü§î 
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: larger; text-align: center;">
						Yeah, it's true that I didn't spend a substantial amount of time with you, but when I look back at the memories now, I truly feel blessed to have had you as a sibling. Despite the limited time we've had together, the moments we shared have left a significant impact on me. I've come to realize how valuable and precious having a sibling like you is. Will always protect you dont worry.

						I want you to know that your kindness and understanding have not gone unnoticed.
						With each passing day, I'm reminded of how lucky I am to call you my sister. Your unwavering love has been a constant reminder that I am never alone. The memories we've shared, the laughter we've enjoyed, and the moments you've comforted me are treasures I hold close to my heart.
					<br>
					<br>
					I remember when you suggested seeing a therapist during a breakdown. At that moment, it felt like someone truly understood that I was going through a tough time due to all the craziness. However, all of that seems small now in light of the Chaarvi and Ansh incident. Yet, once again, you were there to understand that it wasn't easy for me. You listened, and you even went so far as to call her regarding my career. You dedicated two hours to helping me prepare for the Philips interview at 3 am. I apologize for all the disturbances, but I want you to know that you've always been an integral part of my life.I cherish what we have.

Your genuine concern for my happiness and safety is a testament to the extraordinary person you are. I heard you called Yogesh bhaiya after my seizure and I was like wow! just WOW. Thank you for everything , I literally well up thinking about how much you think about me. Thank you for spending your 2 days in Bangalore with me , going out with you really gave me confidence that I can wander this city alone and I did I went to places you suggested and they were fire. thank you for being the most amazing sister.

						Taking a drive through the memory lane, from the days when you branded me with that spatula like I was some kind of cow, to the present where you genuinely care about me, life has undergone a remarkable transformation. Adulting seems to have turned you into a wonderful person.

						I must say, having 1500+ photos of you is a testament to the countless memories we've created together. I recall you talking with Arpan bhaiya when we used to share the same room. I even have memories of throwing his slippers away because I wanted my sister to have no boyfriends (well, I was just a kid, and I wanted to protect you).

						Your cooking is etched in my mind.I remember all these instances vividly. While I might struggle to put them into words perfectly, I can confidently say that you are worthy of being called my sister üëë.

						Thank you for the unforgettable childhood experiences you gifted me. Thank you for playing games with me, being an absolute cutie and making those videos of me with that old Sony camera. 
						<br>
						<br>
						It's the memories we make with others that are forever written in our hearts.

						I also have another request. We have a big family. It's time to stop being such a loner and go out to enjoy with them. Our cousins are wonderful, each with their own unique story that you should know.
